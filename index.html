            <p>Hi there! My name is Rafael Blanco and I'm currently attending Rutgers programming bootcamp to become a full stack web developer. I live in North Jersey and dream of working in New York City or any other big city. I originally graduated from Rutgers Newark with a Bachelor's degree of Science in Business Management. After working for a few years at my family’s business, I decided to make a career change and move into the exciting world of tech. My goal is to become a web developer and work at company that cares about making an impact on the world. I’m fascinated with how much the world has progressed with the help of technology and want to become involved in that process.
